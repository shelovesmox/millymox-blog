Hi there! I'm Mox, a 17-year-old with a keen interest in software engineering and reverse engineering and artifical intelligence. My journey into software engineering began when I was 9, and it's been an adventure filled with learning and discovery ever since.

I like to think of myself as someone who's always ready to learn something new, especially in the world of technology. My passion lies in understanding how things work from the inside out, which naturally led me to the fascinating realms of cybersecurity and software development.

One of my favorite quotes, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do" by Steve Jobs, perfectly sums up my approach to my hobbies and interests. I don't claim to know everythingâ€”far from it, But I'm always eager to explore, understand, and share my findings and thinking with others.
