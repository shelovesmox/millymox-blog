Hi there! I'm Mox, a 17-year-old with a keen interest in offensive security and reverse engineering. My journey into software engineering began when I was 9, and it's been an adventure filled with learning and discovery ever since.

I like to think of myself as someone who's always ready to learn something new, especially in the world of technology. My passion lies in understanding how things work from the inside out, which naturally led me to the fascinating realms of cybersecurity and software development.

One of my favorite quotes, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do" by Steve Jobs, perfectly sums up my approach to my hobbies and interests. I don't claim to know everythingâ€”far from it! But I'm always eager to explore, understand, and share my findings with others who might find them interesting or useful.

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: white; font-size: 35px;">What is meant by "security"?</p>

Security is, in many ways, an elusive concept that delicately straddles the fine line between tangible protection and the abstract notion of safety. It's a concept in constant negotiation between the physical and the psychological realms. Security is as much about the psychological perception of safety as it is about its physical manifestation. After all, what is security if not the sense of safety experienced by the end user? Security represents a quest for stability in a world riddled with unpredictable catastrophes, aiming to provide a sense of predictability and control amidst inherent uncertainty. 

The psychological aspect of security also extends to the mindset of those who threaten it. Understanding the motivations and tactics of potential attackers is important in actually countering threats. Technical skill can only bring you so farm in my opinion, what makes a good security expert isn't their ability to bootstrap solutions for exploits, but also understanding of the human condition that underlies these security challenges.
